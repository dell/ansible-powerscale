Synopsis
--------

Managing NFS zone settings on an PowerScale system includes retrieving details and modifying NFS zone settings.



Requirements

The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- A Dell PowerScale Storage system.
- Ansible-core 2.13 or later.
- Python 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.

    Specifies the access zone in which the NFS zone settings apply.


  nfsv4_allow_numeric_ids (optional, bool, None)
    If ``true``, send owner and groups as UIDs and GIDs when look up fails or *nfsv4_no_names* is set ``rue``.


  nfsv4_domain (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the domain through which users and groups are associated.


  nfsv4_no_domain (optional, bool, None)
    If ``true``, sends owners and groups without a domain name.


  nfsv4_no_domain_uids (optional, bool, None)
    If ``true``, sends UIDs and GIDs without a domain name.


  nfsv4_no_names (optional, bool, None)
    If ``true``, sends owners and groups as UIDs and GIDs.


  nfsv4_replace_domain (optional, bool, None)
    If ``true``, replaces the owner or group domain with an NFS domain name.


  onefs_host (True, str, None)
    IP address or FQDN of the PowerScale cluster.


  port_no (False, str, 8080)
    Port number of the PowerScale cluster.It defaults to 8080 if not specified.


  verify_ssl (True, bool, None)
    boolean variable to specify whether to validate SSL certificate or not.

    ``true`` - indicates that the SSL certificate should be verified.

    ``false`` - indicates that the SSL certificate should not be verified.


  api_user (True, str, None)
    username of the PowerScale cluster.


  api_password (True, str, None)
    the password of the PowerScale cluster.





Notes
