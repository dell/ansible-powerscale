Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- Ansible-core 2.14 or later.
- Python 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.



Parameters
----------

  enable_celog_maintenance_mode (optional, bool, None)
    Enabling CELOG maintenance mode will start a CELOG maintenance window.

    During a CELOG maintenance window, the system will continue to log events, but no alerts will be generated.

    You will have the opportunity to review all events that took place during the maintenance window when disabling maintenance mode.

    Active event groups will automatically resume generating alerts when the scheduled maintenance period ends.


  prune (optional, int, None)
    Removes all maintenance mode history that is greater than set number of days.

    Range of *prune* is 0 to 4294967295.

    If *prune* is set in task, then *changed* will be ``true`` always.


  onefs_host (True, str, None)
    IP address or FQDN of the PowerScale cluster.


  port_no (False, str, 8080)
    Port number of the PowerScale cluster.It defaults to 8080 if not specified.


  verify_ssl (True, bool, None)
    boolean variable to specify whether to validate SSL certificate or not.

    ``true`` - indicates that the SSL certificate should be verified.

    ``false`` - indicates that the SSL certificate should not be verified.


  api_user (True, str, None)
    username of the PowerScale cluster.


  api_password (True, str, None)
    the password of the PowerScale cluster.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - The *check_mode* and idempotency is supported.
   - Idempotency is not supported with *prune* option.
   - The modules present in this collection named as 'dellemc.powerscale' are built to support the Dell PowerScale storage platform.




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Enable CELOG maintenance mode
      dellemc.powerscale.alert_settings:
        onefs_host: "{{ onefs_host }}"
        port_no: "{{ port_no }}"
        api_user: "{{ api_user }}"
        api_password: "{{ api_password }}"
        verify_ssl: "{{ verify_ssl }}"
        enable_celog_maintenance_mode: true

    - name: Disable CELOG and prune all history of maintenance mode
      dellemc.powerscale.alert_settings:
        onefs_host: "{{ onefs_host }}"
        port_no: "{{ port_no }}"
        api_user: "{{ api_user }}"
        api_password: "{{ api_password }}"
        verify_ssl: "{{ verify_ssl }}"
        enable_celog_maintenance_mode: false
        prune: 0
