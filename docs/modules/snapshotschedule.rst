Managing snapshot schedules on PowerScale.

Create snapshot schedule.

Delete snapshot schedule.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- A Dell PowerScale Storage system. Ansible 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14.



Parameters
----------

  name (True, str, None)
    The name of the snapshot schedule.


  path (optional, str, None)
    The path on which the snapshot will be taken. This path is relative to the base path of the Access Zone.

    For 'System' access zone, the path is absolute.

    This parameter is required at the time of creation.

    Modification of the path is not allowed through the Ansible module.


  access_zone (optional, str, System)
    The effective path where the snapshot is created will be determined by the base path of the Access Zone and the path provided by the user in the playbook.


  new_name (optional, str, None)
    The new name of the snapshot schedule.


  desired_retention (optional, int, None)
    The number of hours/days for which snapshots created by this snapshot schedule should be retained.

    If retention is not specified at the time of creation, then the snapshots created by the snapshot schedule will be retained forever.

    Minimum retention duration is 2 hours.

    For large durations (beyond days/weeks), PowerScale may round off the retention to a somewhat larger value to match a whole number of days/weeks.


  retention_unit (optional, str, hours)
    The retention unit for the snapshot created by this schedule.


  alias (optional, str, None)
    The alias will point to the latest snapshot created by the snapshot schedule.


  pattern (optional, str, None)
    Pattern expanded with strftime to create snapshot names.

    This parameter is required at the time of creation.


  schedule (optional, str, None)
    The isidate compatible natural language description of the schedule.

    It specifies the frequency of the schedule.

    This parameter is required at the time of creation.


  state (True, str, None)
    Defines whether the snapshot schedule should exist or not.


  onefs_host (True, str, None)
    IP address or FQDN of the PowerScale cluster.


  port_no (False, str, 8080)
    Port number of the PowerScale cluster.It defaults to 8080 if not specified.


  verify_ssl (True, bool, None)
    boolean variable to specify whether to validate SSL certificate or not.

    True - indicates that the SSL certificate should be verified.

    False - indicates that the SSL certificate should not be verified.


  api_user (True, str, None)
    username of the PowerScale cluster.


  api_password (True, str, None)
    the password of the PowerScale cluster.
