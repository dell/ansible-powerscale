Synopsis
--------

Managing S3 buckets on an PowerScale system includes retrieving details of S3 bucket, creating S3 bucket, modifying and deleting S3 bucket.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- A Dell PowerScale Storage system.
- Ansible-core 2.16 or later.
- Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12.



Parameters
----------

  path (optional, str, None)
    Specifies path on which the S3 bucket will be created. It is the absolute path for System access zone and it is relative if using non-system access zone.

    For example, if your access zone is 'Ansible' and it has a base path '/ifs/ansible' and the path specified is '/user1', then the effective path would be '/ifs/ansible/user1'.

    If your access zone is System, and you have 'directory1' in the access zone, the path provided should be '/ifs/directory1'.

    :emphasis:`path` is required while creating a S3 bucket.

    The S3 bucket path can not be modified after creation.


  create_path (optional, bool, None)
    Will create the path if does not exist.

    API default is :literal:`false`.


  access_zone (optional, str, System)
    Specifies the access zone in which the S3 bucket exists.

    Access zone once set cannot be changed.


  s3_bucket_name (True, str, None)
    Name of the S3 bucket.

    :emphasis:`s3\_bucket\_name` while creating the S3 bucket.


  owner (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the owner of the S3 bucket.

    If :emphasis:`owner` not passed, then :literal:`root` will be default :emphasis:`owner` for :literal:`System` access zone only.

    If owner belongs to another provider domain, it should be mentioned along with domain name as "DOMAIN\_NAME\\\\username" or DOMAIN\_NAME\\username.


  description (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the description of the S3 bucket.

    Pass empty string to remove the :emphasis:`description`.


  object_acl_policy (optional, str, None)
    Set behaviour of object acls for a specified S3 bucket.


  acl (optional, list, None)
    Specifies the permissions and grantees in the S3 bucket.


    permission (True, str, None)
      Specifies the S3 permission being allowed.

      :emphasis:`permission` and :emphasis:`grantee` are required together.


    grantee (True, dict, None)
      Specifies the properties of grantee.

      :emphasis:`permission` and :emphasis:`grantee` are required together.

      It consists of :emphasis:`name`\ , :emphasis:`type`\ , and :emphasis:`provider\_type`.


      name (True, str, None)
        Specifies the name of grantee (user, group or wellknown).


      type (optional, str, user)
        Specifies the type of grantee.


      provider_type (optional, str, local)
        Specifies the provider type of grantee.



    acl_state (optional, str, present)
      Specifies if the acls are to be added or removed.



  state (optional, str, present)
    Defines whether the S3 bucket should exist or not.

    Value :literal:`present` indicates that the S3 bucket should exist in system.

    Value :literal:`absent` indicates that the S3 bucket should not exist in system.


  onefs_host (True, str, None)
    IP address or FQDN of the PowerScale cluster.


  port_no (False, str, 8080)
    Port number of the PowerScale cluster.It defaults to 8080 if not specified.


  verify_ssl (True, bool, None)
    boolean variable to specify whether to validate SSL certificate or not.

    :literal:`true` - indicates that the SSL certificate should be verified.

    :literal:`false` - indicates that the SSL certificate should not be verified.


  api_user (True, str, None)
    username of the PowerScale cluster.


  api_password (True, str, None)
    the password of the PowerScale cluster.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - To delete the S3 bucket, the S3 service must be enabled.
   - The :emphasis:`check\_mode` is supported.
   - The modules present in this collection named as 'dellemc.powerscale' are built to support the Dell PowerScale storage platform.
