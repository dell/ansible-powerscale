Known issues
------------
Known problems in this release are listed.

| **Issue**        | **Description**           | **Resolution**  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Filesystem creation | Creation of a filesystem can fail when api_user: "admin" is used because it is possible that the admin user may not have privileges to set an ACLs. | Assigning privileges ISI_PRIV_IFS_RESTORE and ISI_PRIV_NS_TRAVERSE to the user should enable the creation of filesystem with ACL permissions. |
| Snapshot creation with alias name | Alias name attribute remains null in spite of creating snapshot with alias name | This is an issue with the PowerScale rest API. Alias name is not getting appended to the attribute in response. |
| SyncIQ Job creation/modification/retrieval | When SyncIQ policy has any job of the type "resync_prep/allow_write/allow_write_revert" then creation, modification or retrieval of SyncIQ job will fail with an error saying "Invalid value for 'action', must be one of ['copy', 'sync']". | This is an issue in the supported OneFS versions. |
| SMB share creation with NIS group permissions | Creating a SMB share with NIS group permissions fails with error that the group cannot be found. | This is an issue in the supported OneFS versions. |
| Getting group details  | Getting the details of a group by group_name with provider type as NIS fails. | This is an issue in the supported OneFS versions. |
| Filtering event group info details  | Filtering with query params alert_info for gather_subset event group does not work as expected | This is an issue in the supported OneFS versions. |
| Sorting alert rules info details  | Filtering with query params channels for gather_subset alert rules does not work as expected. | This is an issue in the supported OneFS versions. |
